    american: "The American guinea pig, as you probably guessed, is the most common breed of them all. They are the ones that you probably imagine when you think “guinea pig.” This breed has a really good temperament and tend to get along better with other pigs (but more importantly with children). The reason why they’re so popular is because they’re so easy to take care of. Not all guinea pigs have short hair like the American. And because of this feature, grooming isn’t as time consuming as with the long-haired breeds. I would highly recommend the American if you plan on giving one to a small child. And although they aren’t exactly the most exotic or exciting, they are just as lovable as a Peruvian",
    abyssinian: "One of the older species, the Abyssinian guinea pig is certainly an icebreaker for a new home visitor. They have somewhat long hair with swirls, which make them perfect for show guinea pigs. Eight to ten rosettes (or swirls) is the recommended number by judges if you want to get your pig shown at a competition.But because of the long hair and curls, it’s a bit more difficult to take care of an Abyssinian. Grooming needs to be done more often. This would not be an ideal pet for a child because they are not as low maintenance as, for example, the American. The Abyssinians are known to be naughty and get into extra trouble. But don’t let that deter you from owning one. Their fun and loving personality will certainly make up for the mess they might cause.",
    peruvian: "Of all the different types, the Peruvian guinea pig takes the cake for the longest hair. In fact, the longest hair recorded by any guinea pig (set by a Peruvian) reached 20 inches long! Unlike the Abyssinian, the Peruvian has long straight hair. And although they still require time with grooming, some owners opt to cut their hair short to avoid having to brush everyday. But why get a Peruvian if you plan to shave the guinea pig? If you do choose to keep the long hair, combing is essential, otherwise their hair will likely get tangled and cause discomfort. So, keep that in mind when considering this type.The Peruvian tends to be more alert and curious than all the other breeds. They are just as loving and will often come greet you out of curiosity every chance they get. I would highly recommend them for children, especially if you plan on trimming the hair for them.",
    silkie: "The Silkie guinea pig, also nicknamed the “Sheltie,” is quite similar to the Peruvian in the sense that it has long smooth hair. However, there is a small difference in physical appearance. The hair around their head sweeps back differently, and looks as if it had been purposely slicked back. Because of the styling of the hair, I have heard some really great guinea pig names specific to the Silkie.The long hair requires diligent grooming and isn’t recommended for kids. However, if you’re a parent that is willing to take on that responsibility, then by all means go for it. Their hair is shinier and softer than the Peruvian, so they are great for little kids to play with, just not for them to take care of."
